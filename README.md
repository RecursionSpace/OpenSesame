# OpenSesame

OpenSesame provides an application programming interface (API) between the access control hardware and the access management system. The flexability of OpenSesame accepts a range of authentication input methods with a defined authorization method.

# Compatable Controllers

While OpenSesame can run on prototype/hobby hardware platform a custom board will increase reliability in production environments and improve the instalation process.

# Microcontrollers

## Arduino
OpenSesame_Arduino contains an Arduino compatable project with an .ino file.

## ESP32
TO DO - Port the Arduino code over to become compatable with the ESP32 controller.

# Continuous Integration

All code will need to follow the brest practices and standards outlined by [MISRA](https://www.misra.org.uk/MISRAHome/MISRAC2012/tabid/196/Default.aspx)
