# What is OpenSesame?

[OpenSesame](https://github.com/RecursionSpace/OpenSesame) is an open source access control system. Currently, OpenSesame provides an application programming interface (API) between the access control hardware and the access management system. The flexability of OpenSesame accepts a range of authentication input methods with a defined authorization method.

# Supported Protocols

OpenSesame integrates with the most popular RFID readers that use industry standard communication protocols including:
- Wiegand<sup>*</sup>
- Open Source Device Protocol (OSDP)

_<sup>*</sup>Included for legacy integration, not recommended for new installations due to known security flaws._

# Supported Controllers

While OpenSesame can run on prototype/hobby hardware platform a custom board will increase reliability in production environments and improve the instalation process.

[2] Verified boards have been tested by Recursion.Space with the latest version of OpenSesame to validate functionality. To submit hardware for verification email info@recursion.space_

# Install

At the moment OpenSesame is natively compatable for an Arduino environments. After cloning the repository, open OpenSesame_Arduino.ino and upload to a board.

The next microcontroller to be supported will be the ESP32.

# Continuous Integration

All code will need to follow the brest practices and standards outlined by [MISRA](https://www.misra.org.uk/MISRAHome/MISRAC2012/tabid/196/Default.aspx)

# Community and Contributing

OpenSesame is developed by [Recursion.Space](https://recursion.space/) and by users like you. We welcome both pull requests and issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/RecursionSpace/OpenSesame). Bug fixes and new protocols are encouraged.
