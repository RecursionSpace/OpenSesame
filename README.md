OpenSesame is an open source access management system. OpenSesame sits between a central database and the doors electronic locks.

# Hardware (Control Boards)

While OpenSesame can run on prototype/hobby hardware platform a custom board will increase reliability in production environments and improve the instalation process.

# IDE

To lower participation barriers the Arduino IDE is supported with the use of .ino files.

# Continuous Integration

All code will need to follow the brest practices and standards outlined by [MISRA](https://www.misra.org.uk/MISRAHome/MISRAC2012/tabid/196/Default.aspx)
